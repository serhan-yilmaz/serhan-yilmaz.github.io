## Compendium of Life Principles: How to live a satisfying life and form meaningful relationships?

### Preface

The goal of this writing is to summarize a set of rules that I believe to be important and beneficial to follow while making personal decisions. Most are obvious principles, but they are sometimes overlooked. So, I believe it is helpful to remember and repeat what's important. 

With that, the first principle and a disclaimer to follow: 

##### Principle of Advice

- Take all advice with a grain of salt, think critically and assess limitations
- Realize there is no single answer, multiple paths can reach the same destination
- But, don't ignore what is obvious. If everywhere smells shit, look under your shoe
- Most importantly, live and be true to yourself.

### 1. Relationships

#### Principle of Self-Value

- Value yourself first
- Stand up for yourself, don't let others mistreat you
- Acknowledge that you are not responsible for other people's happiness
- Take responsibility for yourself and your happiness
- Limit altruism, do not sacrifice yourself for others
- Don't be selfless, do not believe others if they claim they are selfless

#### Principle of Reciprocity

- Follow [the rules of reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism)

#### Principle of Nonmaleficence

- Do not harm others if they don't harm you or anyone else
- Do not tolerate, trust or accept those who would use and harm others for selfish reasons
- If retaliation is warranted, make sure magnitude is proportional to, and not exceed the intended harm or actual harm (whichever is greater)
- (Try to) Protect those who are in need, who are harmed by others for selfish reasons. Particularly those who lack the power to protect themselves
    - Only if you can, don't be a hero. See principle of self-value, you are not responsible for other people's happiness. 
    - But remember the poem: ["First they came for..."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...)

#### Principle of Loyalty

- Do not betray those who are loyal to you
- Be loyal to those you trust, and aim for mutual benefit 

#### Principle of Humility and Respect

- Do not think or claim you are more important than others. 
  Everyone is important to themselves from their perspective
- Do not judge others (unless harm is involved)

#### Principle of Authenticity

- Don't lie or mislead others without good reason 
- Do what you say. Say what you do. 
- Follow through your promises.

#### Principle of Attachment

- Be capable of accepting losses
- Don't be afraid to attach, it doesn't have to be permanent
- Walk away, if a relationship becomes consistently harmful 
- Check out [attachment styles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults)

#### Principle of Intimacy

- Aim for consensual, mutual pleasure in sexual relations
- Be safe first, then be open and playful
- Don't underestimate the effect of mentality and emotionality 
- Don't assume porn and erotica reflect reality 

### 2. Happiness

### 3. Health

### Closing Remarks
